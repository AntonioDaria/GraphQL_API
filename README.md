# GraphQL_API
A basic GraphQL  API using Nodejs and express server

# How to run 
- clone the code to your local machine
- npm i to install dependencies
- Go to http://localhost:4000/graphql to test the end point for Rootquery and Mutation

# Things to Improve
- At the moment this backend uses dummy data, the idea is to add a MySql database and Use Squelize (ORM) To query it
